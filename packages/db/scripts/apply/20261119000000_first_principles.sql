-- First principles per process version (issue #119, A54; docs/research/first-principles.md Part B).
--
-- A consultant strips a process back to seven short answers: the job it does, hard truths against assumptions,
-- requirements with a named owner, delete candidates, what to simplify, accelerate and automate, the root cause of
-- the biggest problem, and success measures. The analysis judges the process against them, and the "goals met" rule
-- (docs/analysis-rules.md rule 11) reads the success measures.
--
-- One row per process revision (a draft, the live version or an earlier one), so a published version keeps the
-- first principles it was published with and the History page can show how they changed. The seven answers are
-- stored as the research note's sketch has them: the job and the root cause as plain text columns, the lists the
-- rule checks read (truths and assumptions, requirements, delete candidates, improvements, success measures) as
-- jsonb arrays. The database checks that each part is the right kind of JSON and its size; the shape of the items
-- is held by the app (packages/engine/src/first-principles.ts), so adding a field later needs no migration.
--
-- Edits go into the process's draft, like the steps and edges (docs/adr/0004-drafts-as-revisions.md): the existing
-- `edit_drafts_only` trigger refuses a write to a published or superseded revision. A draft opened from live starts
-- with no row; the app copies the live row into it on the first save, and reads the nearest earlier row for a
-- revision that has none. Everyone in the workspace reads; owners and editors write; `anon` has nothing. The same
-- policies as `lever_settings` and `client_groups`. MCP writes are audit-logged by the `audit_mcp` trigger, as for
-- sources and issues.
--
-- Strictly additive: table `public.first_principles`, its `set_updated_at`, `edit_drafts_only` and `audit_mcp`
-- triggers, row-level security and four policies. `save_fields`, `save_links`, `open_draft`, `publish_process` and
-- every existing table are unchanged.
--
-- Preflight (run with `bash packages/db/scripts/prod-sql.sh -c "..."`):

--        select table_name from information_schema.tables

--        and proname in ('edit_drafts_only', 'audit_mcp_write', 'set_updated_at');
--   3. Nothing of ours is applied past this one. Expect 0 rows:
