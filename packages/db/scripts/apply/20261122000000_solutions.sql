-- Solutions as their own thing (issue #114, ticket A49; decisions D18 amended by D25, D22).
--
-- A solution is a separate copy of a process with changed steps, plus optional lever changes. A process can have many.
-- One solution can solve several issues, with an automatic verdict against each issue's target and the user's own
-- verdict. Drafts stay single (D18): a process still has one live version and at most one draft, and a solution never
-- touches either. It is its own row, with its own copy of the steps.
--
-- What is new:
--
--   * `public.solutions`: workspace, the process it changes, the revision it was copied from (`base_revision_id`), its
--     name, the copy as one jsonb document (`steps`, the same shape as a block's bundle: `{steps, edges, entry_step_id}`,
--     step and edge rows without their revision, workspace and process; the whole map as the solution has it, so it can
--     be drawn and simulated without the revision it came from), `changed_step_ids` (the steps it added or changed, by
--     stable step id, so the map can show what is new), `lever_changes` (an array of scenario patches, "more leads",
--     "faster proposals"), the author and the date.
--   * `public.solution_issues`: which issues a solution solves. One row per (solution, issue), holding the automatic
--     verdict (`auto_verdict`: pass or fail against the issue's target, from the simulation; null when the target text
--     could not be turned into a number the simulation computes), how often it holds across the simulation's runs
--     (`holds_pct`, 0 to 100), a line saying what it was checked against, the user's own verdict (`user_verdict`) and
--     notes. Both tables carry the workspace and key their foreign keys on it, so a link cannot cross workspaces.
--   * Linking a solution to an issue moves the issue to Testing solutions and logs a `solution_tested` event. It reuses
--     A47's mechanism rather than a second one: an Open issue is updated to the stored status `in_progress` (see
--     packages/db/src/issue-status.ts), and A47's `issue_log` trigger writes the event; this migration's trigger then adds
--     the solution to that event's detail. An issue already being tested keeps its status, and a
--     `solution_tested` event is written for the new link in the same table.
--   * `public.save_solution(...)`: creates a solution and its links in one transaction (security invoker, so row-level
--     security applies to every write), so a solution is never saved without the link the person asked for.
--
-- Row-level security as the other workspace tables: every member of the workspace reads, owners, editors and agency
-- admins write (`can_edit_workspace`), `anon` has no access. Updates are limited by column grants: a solution's name and
-- notes, a link's user verdict and notes; everything else (the copy, the base revision, which issue, the automatic verdict)
-- is fixed when it is saved, so a link cannot be rewritten without the history logging it.
--
-- Checks in the database (before-insert triggers, so they hold for every writer, with plain messages):
--   * a solution's base revision must be a published revision of its process. A draft can be discarded, and a solution
--     pointing at one would block that (D18: drafts stay single and are never a solution's base);
--   * an issue can be linked only if it is about the solution's process (its own process, or one of its links), is not a
--     detection, and is still open or being tested (not resolved, won't fix or dismissed).
--
-- STRICTLY ADDITIVE: two tables, their indexes, triggers, policies, three trigger functions and one function. No existing
-- table, column, constraint or function is changed. It needs A47's `issue_events` and `issues` (applied before this) and
-- the `can_read_workspace`, `can_edit_workspace` and `set_updated_at` helpers. It creates the unique index on
-- process_revisions (id, process_id, workspace_id) only if A54 has not already.
