It is run again under each market condition on its own (Stable, Soft, Downturn, Boom and any of your own from Settings), and each linked issue's goal is checked the same way as the automatic verdict. Pass means every issue it could check still meets its goal. Each named market replaces your market schedule for the whole run, so Stable is a flat market, not your schedule; the “Your schedule” row, when you have one, is the schedule month by month, which is what the automatic verdict under Solves was checked against.",
