--
--   -- 1. The table does not exist yet: expect 0.
--   select count(*) from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'blocks';
--
--   -- 2. Nothing applied past this one: expect no rows.
--   select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version >= '20261117000000';
--
--   -- 3. The helpers the policies use exist: expect 3 rows.
--   select proname from pg_proc where pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace and proname in ('can_read_workspace', 'can_edit_workspace', 'set_updated_at');
--
-- Verify after applying: row-level security is on (select relrowsecurity from pg_class where relname = 'blocks'), four policies
-- (select polname from pg_policy where polrelid = 'public.blocks'::regclass), anon cannot select from it, and the schema_migrations row exists.

-- Block library (issue #116, ticket A51): a block is a saved bundle of steps that can be reused in any
-- process or solution. Built by hand in the Editor's block mode, or saved from a group of steps ("manual"),
-- or made by the AI ideas of A52 ("ai").
--
-- One row per block, per workspace. `steps` holds the bundle as one jsonb document:
--
--   { "steps": [ ...step rows without revision_id, workspace_id and process_id... ],
--     "edges": [ ...edge rows without those three... ],
--     "entry_step_id": "<id of the top-level step the block is entered at, or null>" }
--
-- Groups, at any depth, are steps of kind `group` with `parent_step_id` set, as in a process. The ids inside the
-- bundle are local to it: inserting a block into a process gives every step and edge a fresh id (the app does that),
-- so a block never shares an id with a live step. The app checks the shape of the bundle; the database checks only
-- that it is an object with `steps` and `edges` arrays and is not huge (it is read on every page of the library).
--
-- Why a jsonb document and not rows in `steps`: a block belongs to no process revision, steps have a revision
-- foreign key, and a block is always read and written whole.
--
-- Row-level security as the other workspace tables (client_groups, lever_settings): every member of the workspace
-- reads, owners and editors write; `anon` has no access.
--
-- Strictly additive: table `public.blocks`, its index, `set_updated_at` trigger, row-level security and four
-- policies. `save_fields`, `save_links` and every existing table are unchanged.
--
-- Preflight (run with `bash packages/db/scripts/prod-sql.sh -c "..."`):
--
--   1. The table must not exist yet. Expect 0 rows:
--        select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'blocks';
--   2. Nothing of ours is applied past this one. Expect 0 rows:
--        select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version >= '20261117000000';
--

--   begin;
--   drop table if exists public.blocks;   -- drops its index, trigger and policies with it
--   delete from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version = '20261117000000';
