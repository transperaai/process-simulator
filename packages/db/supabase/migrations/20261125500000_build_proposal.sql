-- Build a solution idea (issue #117, ticket A52, slice 2 of 2; PRD §7.1c).
--
-- "Build it" on a solution idea opens the Editor in solution mode with the idea's steps placed. Saving turns it into a real
-- solution through `public.save_solution` (A49), and the idea is marked `built`, in the same transaction, so an idea is never
-- built twice and a solution is never saved without the idea knowing. This adds the one function that does both:
--
--   * `public.build_proposal(p_proposal, p_workspace, p_process, p_base_revision, p_name, p_steps, p_changed, p_levers,
--     p_links)`: security invoker, so row-level security applies to everything it writes. It locks the proposal (it must be a
--     pending solution idea of that workspace), calls `save_solution` with the rest, then sets the proposal to `built` with
--     `applied = {solution_id}` and who and when. The decision columns change only here and in `review_proposals`: the guard
--     trigger (`private.suggestion_proposals_before_write`) is unchanged. An API-token request (the MCP server) can't build: a
--     person decides, as with `review_proposals`. The solution must be linked to the idea's own issue (`p_links` must name it), so
--     an idea can't be marked built by a solution that has nothing to do with it; `save_solution` then checks that issue is about
--     the solution's process.
--
-- The solution's origin is recorded on the idea (`applied.solution_id`), not on `solutions`, so the solutions table is not
-- touched. A solution made from an AI idea is one whose id is in `suggestion_proposals.applied ->> 'solution_id'` with status
-- `built`: A50's "Type: AI block" label can read it from there.
--
-- STRICTLY ADDITIVE: one function. No table, column, constraint, trigger or existing function is changed. Needs 20261122000000
-- (`save_solution`) and 20261124000000 (`suggestion_proposals`).
--
-- Preflight (run with `bash packages/db/scripts/prod-sql.sh -c "..."`; each should be as described):
--
--   1. The function does not exist yet. Expect 0:
--        select count(*) from pg_proc where pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace and proname = 'build_proposal';
--   2. Nothing of ours is applied past this one. Expect 0 rows:
--        select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version >= '20261125500000';
--   3. The migrations it builds on are applied (solutions, suggestions_v2, source_links, and the one at 20261125000000). Expect 4 rows:
--        select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version in ('20261122000000', '20261124000000', '20261124500000', '20261125000000') order by 1;
--   4. save_solution and suggestion_proposals exist. Expect 2 rows:
--        select proname from pg_proc where pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace and proname = 'save_solution'
--        union all select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'suggestion_proposals';
--   5. The table's columns, in order. Expect id,workspace_id,kind,title,detail,payload,evidence,note,issue_id,status,created_via,proposer_name,proposer_email,applied,review_note,reviewed_by,reviewed_at,created_at,updated_at,created_by:
--        select string_agg(column_name, ',' order by ordinal_position) from information_schema.columns where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'suggestion_proposals';
--   6. The two functions this one relies on are as reviewed. Expect 73793c55eefd0e3dd9d4ca7a3ff027e4, then 2ca045826e8dbfdb797d2147d8a84b8e:
--        select md5(pg_get_functiondef('public.save_solution(uuid, uuid, uuid, text, jsonb, jsonb, jsonb, jsonb)'::regprocedure));
--        select md5(pg_get_functiondef('private.suggestion_proposals_before_write()'::regprocedure));
--
-- Post-apply grant check (authenticated may execute it; anon and PUBLIC may not):
--        select grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.routine_privileges where routine_schema = 'public' and routine_name = 'build_proposal' and grantee in ('anon', 'authenticated', 'PUBLIC') order by 1;
--        select proacl from pg_proc where pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace and proname = 'build_proposal';
--   Expect: one row, authenticated EXECUTE; and an ACL with an `authenticated=X/...` entry and no `anon=` and no `=X/...` (an entry with
--   an empty grantee is PUBLIC).
--
-- Rollback (run as one transaction; nothing existing was changed):
--
--   begin;
--   drop function if exists public.build_proposal(uuid, uuid, uuid, uuid, text, jsonb, jsonb, jsonb, jsonb);
--   delete from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version = '20261125500000';
--   commit;
--
-- Ideas already built stay `built` and keep their `applied.solution_id`; solutions they made stay.
--
-- Production data: none needed.
