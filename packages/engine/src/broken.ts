// Broken scenarios (docs/PRD.md §4.1 "Levers and scenarios", §6.2, decision
// D10; issue #16).
//
// A saved scenario names its targets by id (`steps.<step_id>.work_hours`).
// When the model changes under it (a step is deleted, or split or replaced in
// the editor, a person leaves), a target can stop resolving. Such a scenario
// "needs attention": it is never run with the bad patch skipped, because that
// would quietly turn a saved fix into a fix worth nothing. Instead:
//
// - `checkScenario` re-resolves every patch against the current model and
//   says which ones broke, naming the old step and, when the editor recorded
//   `replaced_by` on it, the step(s) that replaced it (following replacements
//   of replacements), so the patch can be re-pointed;
// - `resolveScenario` is model resolution for a run: it refuses a broken
//   scenario with a `BrokenScenarioError` instead of skipping patches;
// - `detectBrokenScenarios` raises one `broken_scenario` detected issue per
//   broken scenario, with a stable key, so the register shows it while it is
//   broken and it disappears (resolves) once the scenario is fixed.
//
// Pure, deterministic and templated like the rest of the engine: no I/O, no
// clock, no language model.
