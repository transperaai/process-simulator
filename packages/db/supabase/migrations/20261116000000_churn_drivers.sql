-- Churn drivers (docs/PRD.md decisions D21 and D28; issue #121, ticket A56): the
-- reasons clients leave. Base churn per service (the client group's "normal
-- churn", A55) is multiplied by what is going on around each client, and each
-- driver has a weight (0 to 3; 1 is normal, 0 ignores it) and an on/off
-- switch. Ten drivers are built in (the engine measures what it can and takes
-- the rest as a stated assumption you enter); you can add your own, with a
-- name, a one-sentence description and an example.
--
-- One row per driver you have set, per workspace. A built-in with no row is at
-- its default (late work and the market on at weight 1, the rest off), and
-- that default is exactly how the engine churned clients before drivers
-- existed, so a workspace with no rows simulates as it always did. The app
-- creates a built-in's row the first time you change it.
--
--   driver       late, resp, onb, rework, load, handoff, results, tenure,
--                price or market for the ten built-ins; null for your own.
--   name, description, example   your own drivers only.
--   weight       0 to 3.
--   enabled      the on/off switch.
--   value        what you enter, where the driver takes a number: normal first
--                delivery in working days (onb), account manager changes per
--                client a year (handoff), average rating out of 10 (results),
--                times as likely to leave in months 1 to 6 (tenure), planned
--                price rise in percent (price), and for your own driver the
--                extra churn it causes at weight 1, in percent.
--   month        price changes only: the month of the run (1 to 24) the rise
--                takes effect.
--
-- A driver is a company-model fact, like a client group: the MCP server can't
-- write it directly (it suggests; decision D19) and every write is audited,
-- with `private.company_needs_review` and `private.audit_company_write`
-- (20261015000000_suggestions.sql, the former redefined in
-- 20261021000000_roles_and_workspaces.sql). A person changing weight,
-- enabled, value or month stamps its provenance `entered`.
--
-- Strictly additive: one new table with its triggers, policies and grants, and
-- a function and trigger that cap a workspace at 25 drivers of its own.
-- `save_fields` is not touched: a driver is saved as a whole row.
--
-- Rollback (run as one transaction):
--
--   begin;
--   -- (dropping the table drops its triggers and policies)
--   drop table public.churn_drivers;
--   drop function if exists private.check_churn_driver_limit();
--   delete from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version = '20261116000000';
--   commit;
--
-- Rolling back deletes every weight, switch and driver of your own.
