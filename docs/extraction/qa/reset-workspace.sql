-- Remove the Copperleaf Marketing (QA) workspace and everything in it: its
-- processes, sources, suggestions, issues, memberships and company model
-- (issue #27; docs/extraction/qa/README.md). It touches only the workspace whose
-- slug is `copperleaf-qa`, and does nothing if there isn't one. API tokens that
-- pointed at it keep working and simply have no active workspace.
--
-- Run it in the Supabase SQL editor.
