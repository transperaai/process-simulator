-- Production apply file for 20261120000000_issues_v2 (A47, issue #112). Run after A54 (20261119000000) and A40 (20261118000000).
--
-- Strictly additive: nothing existing is dropped, renamed or rewritten, so it is safe to apply before or after the deploy.
--
-- Preflight (run first; each should be as described):
--
--   -- 1. The new tables do not exist yet: expect 0.
--   select count(*) from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name in ('issue_links', 'issue_owners', 'issue_sources', 'issue_events');
--
--   -- 2. Every status is one the check allows (it is not being changed): expect no rows.
--   select status, count(*) from public.issues where status not in ('open', 'in_progress', 'done', 'dismissed') group by 1;
--
--   -- 3. Nothing applied past this one: expect no rows.
--   select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version >= '20261120000000';
--
--   -- 4. What will be migrated (counts per status; how many name a step or an owner).
--   select status, count(*), count(step_id) as with_step, count(owner_person_id) as with_owner from public.issues group by 1;
--
-- Verify after applying: row-level security is on for the four new tables (select relname, relrowsecurity from pg_class where relname like 'issue_%'),
-- every issue has a number (select count(*) from public.issues where number is null and status <> 'dismissed': expect 0), `select status, count(*) from public.issues group by 1`
-- shows only open, in_progress, done, dismissed (unchanged) and `select resolution, count(*) from public.issues group by 1` only nulls, each issue has a 'created' row in issue_events, and the schema_migrations row exists.
--
-- Post-deploy reconciliation (run after the new app is deployed; the old app can edit issues between applying this and
-- the deploy, and it only writes the compatibility columns). Lists issues whose process_id, step_id or owner_person_id
-- is not among their links or owners. Expect no rows; for any it lists, add the missing link or owner:
--
--   select i.id, i.number, i.process_id, i.step_id, i.owner_person_id
--   from public.issues i
--   where (i.step_id is not null and not exists (select 1 from public.issue_links l where l.issue_id = i.id and l.step_id = i.step_id))
--      or (i.step_id is null and i.process_id is not null and not exists (select 1 from public.issue_links l where l.issue_id = i.id and l.process_id = i.process_id and l.step_id is null))
--      or (i.owner_person_id is not null and not exists (select 1 from public.issue_owners o where o.issue_id = i.id and o.person_id = i.owner_person_id));
--
--   -- and the fix, idempotent (the history log notes each as an edit):
--   insert into public.issue_links (issue_id, workspace_id, process_id, step_id)
--     select i.id, i.workspace_id, coalesce(i.process_id, (select s.process_id from public.steps s where s.id = i.step_id and s.workspace_id = i.workspace_id limit 1)), i.step_id
--     from public.issues i where (i.step_id is not null or i.process_id is not null)
--       and not exists (select 1 from public.issue_links l where l.issue_id = i.id and l.step_id is not distinct from i.step_id)
--     on conflict do nothing;
--   insert into public.issue_owners (issue_id, person_id, workspace_id)
--     select id, owner_person_id, workspace_id from public.issues where owner_person_id is not null on conflict do nothing;

-- Issues v2: data (issue #112, ticket A47). An issue is a problem someone confirmed, from acknowledging an insight
-- or added by hand. This migration reshapes the register's data; the Acknowledge dialog (apps/web) writes it.
--
-- STRICTLY ADDITIVE (expand only). It drops, renames and rewrites nothing that exists: the `issues_status` check, the
-- existing status values, `private.issues_before_write` and its trigger are all left exactly as they are, so the
-- deployed app and MCP server keep working before, during and after this is applied, in either order with the deploy.
-- A later "contract" migration (rewrite the stored statuses, tighten the check) is future work that needs Austin's
-- go-ahead; see docs/production-migrations.md.
--
-- What is new, all next to the existing `issues` table:
--
--   * `issue_links`: what an issue touches. A row with a null `step_id` is the whole process; rows with a `step_id`
--     are steps (a step's stable id, so no foreign key: steps are keyed by revision; `save_issue` checks each is a step
--     of the link's process in the workspace). An issue may touch several steps, even in different processes.
--     `issues.process_id` and `issues.step_id` stay, as the first link, for compatibility; `save_issue` keeps them in
--     step, and a trigger seeds the links of an issue inserted any other way from those columns.
--   * `issue_owners`: several owners, people. `issues.owner_person_id` stays as the first owner, and a trigger seeds an
--     issue inserted any other way from it.
--   * `issue_sources`: linked sources. (`issues.evidence_sources` stays, unused by new code.)
--   * `issues.target_measure`, `target_now`, `target_goal`: "Wait at Check fit", "1.4 d", "under 4 hours". Free text.
--   * Statuses, held as the values the check already allows plus one new column:
--         shown               status         resolution
--         Open                open           null
--         Testing solutions   in_progress    null
--         Resolved            done           null
--         Won't fix           done           'wont_fix'
--         (dismissed insight) dismissed      null
--     `issues.resolution` (null, or 'wont_fix') is new; a trigger clears it unless the status is `done`. The app and the
--     MCP server map between the two in one place (packages/db/src/issue-status.ts); `save_issue` takes the shown names
--     and stores the old spellings plus the resolution. `resolved_at` is set for `done` and `dismissed` as it always was.
--     `dismissed` is not an issue a person sees: it is what A45 stores for an insight someone dismissed (a tracked row,
--     so the insight stays gone). The register, the map, the counts and the insight list leave it out, and nothing in the
--     app lets a person pick it; `save_issue` only sets it on a row that carries a detection key.
--   * `issues.number`: a stable number per workspace (Issue #12), assigned by a new BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE trigger
--     (`issues_number`) from `private.issue_counters` (one row per workspace; the upsert's row lock makes concurrent
--     inserts take turns). Never reused, even after a delete, and can't be changed. A dismissed insight is not an issue,
--     so it has no number (null) and uses none up; it gets one if it is acknowledged later. The number is taken before
--     a conflict is known, so an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` that does nothing still uses one: expect a gap there
--     (a rolled-back insert gives its number back, as the counter row is part of the transaction).
--   * `issues.dismissed_revision_id`: the process's live revision a dismissed insight was dismissed against. A
--     dismissal lasts until the process's next published version: the app lists a dismissed insight again once its
--     process has a different live revision and the analysis still detects it, and a re-dismiss writes the new revision
--     here. Null means "before any version" (the process had never been published): it expires on the first publish.
--     The trigger clears it when the row stops being dismissed.
--   * `issue_events`: the history log. created, edited, solution_tested, resolved, reopened, each with a date (`at`)
--     and who (`actor`, null for a system change), and a `detail` (changed fields, status from and to, and the links,
--     owners and sources added or removed). A dismissed insight writes none (it is not an issue yet); acknowledging it
--     writes `created`. Written only by triggers (security definer) on `issues` and on the three link tables, so every
--     change logs whichever way it is made and nobody can edit or forge a row. A link change inside a transaction that
--     already logged the issue is added to that event's detail instead of a second event.
--   * `public.save_issue(...)`: one call that creates or edits an issue with its links, owners and sources in one
--     transaction (so one history entry), as the signed-in user (security invoker: RLS applies).
--
-- Severity: the `severity` column already holds the four ratings (critical = Operational risk, serious = Bad, warning =
-- Good could improve, info = Great; engine `ratingOfStored`, A41). No data changes; the migration test checks it.
--
-- Existing issues are migrated in place, additively: their step and process become `issue_links` rows (a step's process
-- looked up from `steps` when the issue didn't name one), their owner an `issue_owners` row, their cited sources
-- `issue_sources` rows, they get numbers in the order they were logged (oldest first; a dismissed one gets none), and
-- each gets a `created` event at its `created_at` (plus `resolved` at `resolved_at` for the closed ones). A migrated
-- dismissed row takes the live revision of its process (`dismissed_revision_id`) where that can be worked out. No
-- existing column value changes, so nothing is lost.
--
-- `save_fields` is not redefined: `issues` is already in its allow-list, and an edit through it logs too.
--
-- Preflight (run first, each should be as described):
--   1. The new tables do not exist yet. Expect 0:
--        select count(*) from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name in ('issue_links', 'issue_owners', 'issue_sources', 'issue_events');
--   2. Nothing of ours is applied past this one. Expect 0 rows:
--        select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version >= '20261120000000';
--   3. A look at what will be migrated (counts per status and how many name a step or an owner):
--        select status, count(*), count(step_id) as with_step, count(owner_person_id) as with_owner from public.issues group by 1;
--
-- Rollback (run as one transaction; nothing existing was changed, so there is nothing to put back and nothing is mapped
-- to `dismissed`; it loses the history log, the extra links, owners and sources, targets, numbers and resolutions):

insert into supabase_migrations.schema_migrations (version, name, statements) values ('20261120000000', 'issues_v2', array[$mig$-- Issues v2: data (issue #112, ticket A47). An issue is a problem someone confirmed, from acknowledging an insight
-- or added by hand. This migration reshapes the register's data; the Acknowledge dialog (apps/web) writes it.
--
-- STRICTLY ADDITIVE (expand only). It drops, renames and rewrites nothing that exists: the `issues_status` check, the
-- existing status values, `private.issues_before_write` and its trigger are all left exactly as they are, so the
-- deployed app and MCP server keep working before, during and after this is applied, in either order with the deploy.
-- A later "contract" migration (rewrite the stored statuses, tighten the check) is future work that needs Austin's
-- go-ahead; see docs/production-migrations.md.
--
-- What is new, all next to the existing `issues` table:
--
--   * `issue_links`: what an issue touches. A row with a null `step_id` is the whole process; rows with a `step_id`
--     are steps (a step's stable id, so no foreign key: steps are keyed by revision; `save_issue` checks each is a step
--     of the link's process in the workspace). An issue may touch several steps, even in different processes.
--     `issues.process_id` and `issues.step_id` stay, as the first link, for compatibility; `save_issue` keeps them in
--     step, and a trigger seeds the links of an issue inserted any other way from those columns.
--   * `issue_owners`: several owners, people. `issues.owner_person_id` stays as the first owner, and a trigger seeds an
--     issue inserted any other way from it.
--   * `issue_sources`: linked sources. (`issues.evidence_sources` stays, unused by new code.)
--   * `issues.target_measure`, `target_now`, `target_goal`: "Wait at Check fit", "1.4 d", "under 4 hours". Free text.
--   * Statuses, held as the values the check already allows plus one new column:
--         shown               status         resolution
--         Open                open           null
--         Testing solutions   in_progress    null
--         Resolved            done           null
--         Won't fix           done           'wont_fix'
--         (dismissed insight) dismissed      null
--     `issues.resolution` (null, or 'wont_fix') is new; a trigger clears it unless the status is `done`. The app and the
--     MCP server map between the two in one place (packages/db/src/issue-status.ts); `save_issue` takes the shown names
--     and stores the old spellings plus the resolution. `resolved_at` is set for `done` and `dismissed` as it always was.
--     `dismissed` is not an issue a person sees: it is what A45 stores for an insight someone dismissed (a tracked row,
--     so the insight stays gone). The register, the map, the counts and the insight list leave it out, and nothing in the
--     app lets a person pick it; `save_issue` only sets it on a row that carries a detection key.
--   * `issues.number`: a stable number per workspace (Issue #12), assigned by a new BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE trigger
--     (`issues_number`) from `private.issue_counters` (one row per workspace; the upsert's row lock makes concurrent
--     inserts take turns). Never reused, even after a delete, and can't be changed. A dismissed insight is not an issue,
--     so it has no number (null) and uses none up; it gets one if it is acknowledged later. The number is taken before
--     a conflict is known, so an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` that does nothing still uses one: expect a gap there
--     (a rolled-back insert gives its number back, as the counter row is part of the transaction).
--   * `issues.dismissed_revision_id`: the process's live revision a dismissed insight was dismissed against. A
--     dismissal lasts until the process's next published version: the app lists a dismissed insight again once its
--     process has a different live revision and the analysis still detects it, and a re-dismiss writes the new revision
--     here. Null means "before any version" (the process had never been published): it expires on the first publish.
--     The trigger clears it when the row stops being dismissed.
--   * `issue_events`: the history log. created, edited, solution_tested, resolved, reopened, each with a date (`at`)
--     and who (`actor`, null for a system change), and a `detail` (changed fields, status from and to, and the links,
--     owners and sources added or removed). A dismissed insight writes none (it is not an issue yet); acknowledging it
--     writes `created`. Written only by triggers (security definer) on `issues` and on the three link tables, so every
--     change logs whichever way it is made and nobody can edit or forge a row. A link change inside a transaction that
--     already logged the issue is added to that event's detail instead of a second event.
--   * `public.save_issue(...)`: one call that creates or edits an issue with its links, owners and sources in one
--     transaction (so one history entry), as the signed-in user (security invoker: RLS applies).
--
-- Severity: the `severity` column already holds the four ratings (critical = Operational risk, serious = Bad, warning =
-- Good could improve, info = Great; engine `ratingOfStored`, A41). No data changes; the migration test checks it.
--
-- Existing issues are migrated in place, additively: their step and process become `issue_links` rows (a step's process
-- looked up from `steps` when the issue didn't name one), their owner an `issue_owners` row, their cited sources
-- `issue_sources` rows, they get numbers in the order they were logged (oldest first; a dismissed one gets none), and
-- each gets a `created` event at its `created_at` (plus `resolved` at `resolved_at` for the closed ones). A migrated
-- dismissed row takes the live revision of its process (`dismissed_revision_id`) where that can be worked out. No
-- existing column value changes, so nothing is lost.
--
-- `save_fields` is not redefined: `issues` is already in its allow-list, and an edit through it logs too.
--
-- Preflight (run first, each should be as described):
--   1. The new tables do not exist yet. Expect 0:
--        select count(*) from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name in ('issue_links', 'issue_owners', 'issue_sources', 'issue_events');
--   2. Nothing of ours is applied past this one. Expect 0 rows:
--        select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version >= '20261120000000';
--   3. A look at what will be migrated (counts per status and how many name a step or an owner):
--        select status, count(*), count(step_id) as with_step, count(owner_person_id) as with_owner from public.issues group by 1;
--
-- Rollback (run as one transaction; nothing existing was changed, so there is nothing to put back and nothing is mapped
-- to `dismissed`; it loses the history log, the extra links, owners and sources, targets, numbers and resolutions):
--
--   begin;
--   drop function if exists public.save_issue(uuid, jsonb, uuid, jsonb, uuid[], uuid[]);
--   drop table if exists public.issue_events, public.issue_sources, public.issue_owners, public.issue_links;
