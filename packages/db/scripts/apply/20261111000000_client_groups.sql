-- Client groups (docs/PRD.md §3 "Client group", decisions D21 and D27; issue #120,
-- ticket A55). Clients are counted per service instead of named: one row per
-- service with the number of clients, their average fee a month, normal churn
-- a month, typical stay in months and starting health (0 to 100). The engine
-- simulates that many unnamed clients from these numbers, so late or missed
-- servicing work still lowers health and drives churn. A workspace with client
-- groups no longer simulates its named clients.
--
-- The named-client tables (`clients`, `client_services`, `client_assignments`)
-- are untouched: the app stops showing them, the data stays (nothing is
-- deleted), and a workspace with no client groups still simulates its named
-- clients exactly as before.
--
-- Backfill (additive insert only): every service that has active named clients
-- gets one group, so existing workspaces keep their numbers when they switch
-- to groups. Count: the active named clients taking the service. Fee: their
-- average MRR, a client's MRR split evenly across its services. Clients with a
-- start date in the future are left out. Starting health: their average health
-- (the workspace's `health_initial` setting, else 80, when none is entered).
-- A count above 2,000 is capped at 2,000. Normal churn and typical stay: the service's own base churn and
-- expected tenure. Services with no named clients get no row (their group
-- shows blank in Settings and is created on the first edit). Existing groups
-- are never changed (`on conflict do nothing`).
--
-- The benchmark the People page compares company client health against
-- (for example 70 to 80 for a small agency) is two optional keys of
-- `workspaces.settings`, `client_health_benchmark_low` and
-- `client_health_benchmark_high` (0 to 100): no schema change.
--
-- A group is a company-model fact, like the service it belongs to: the MCP
-- server can't write it directly (it suggests; decision D19) and every write
-- is audited, with `private.company_needs_review` and
-- `private.audit_company_write` (20261015000000_suggestions.sql, the former
-- redefined in 20261021000000_roles_and_workspaces.sql).
--
-- Strictly additive: one new table with its triggers, policies and grants,
-- the backfill insert, and `save_fields` redefined with `client_groups`
-- appended to its allow-list (nothing else in it changes).
--
-- Rollback (run as one transaction):
--
--   begin;
--   -- (dropping the table drops its triggers and policies)
--   drop table public.client_groups;
--   -- Restore save_fields' previous allow-list: re-run the `create or replace
--   -- function public.save_fields ... $$;` block from 20261016000000_servicing.sql.
--   -- (Or leave it: with the table gone, a save to it just errors.)
--   delete from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version = '20261111000000';
--   commit;

--   Optionally remove the benchmark keys:
--   update public.workspaces set settings = settings - 'client_health_benchmark_low' - 'client_health_benchmark_high';
