// Market conditions (docs/PRD.md decision D29): the outside climate for demand,
// as seven factors that scale today's numbers (1 = same as today). A model
// carries a 24-month schedule of them (`EngineModel.market`) and the engine
// applies each month's factors as the run goes. Stable in every month changes
// nothing: such a model is simulated exactly as one with no market at all.
//
// What each factor does in the engine:
//   leads   arrival rate (demand.ts), month by month.
//   conv    the share of enquiries that reach a `won` end: at a step, the
//           probability of the edges that lead to a won end is scaled and the
//           other edges share the rest in proportion.
//   cycle   external wait ("time to decide") at pipeline steps.
//   price   the fee of each retainer or one-off won in that month, for its life
//           (new MRR, billed, LTV added).
//   churn   monthly churn of every active client.
//   hire, pay  stored and exposed, but the engine has no hiring or cash-flow
//           model yet, so they change no simulated number.
