-- Suggestions v2: proposed issues and solution ideas (issue #117, ticket A52, slice 1 of 2; PRD §7.1c, §8 screen 8).
--
-- Everything AI proposes waits in Suggestions until someone acts on it. Company-model changes already do (the
-- `suggestions` table, migration 20261015000000, and its `review_suggestions`). This adds the other two kinds:
--
--   * a proposed issue: accepting it creates a real issue through `public.save_issue`, the same call the Acknowledge
--     dialog makes (A47), so it gets its number, its links and its `created` history entry; rejecting it records the
--     decision and takes it off the list;
--   * a solution idea: a plain-words idea for one issue, with the steps the AI would place. It is not built and not
--     simulated. Slice 1 stores and lists these and lets someone dismiss them. "Build it" (open the Editor in solution
--     mode with the steps placed) and the block map are slice 2, which is also where an idea gets its `built` outcome.
--     B4's play links (#33) will insert their visitors' proposals as solution ideas with `created_via = 'play_link'`
--     and the visitor's name and email, through their own rate-limited function; none of that plumbing exists yet.
--
-- Why a new table and not new kinds in `suggestions`: that table is company-model only (`target_table` and `patch` are
-- NOT NULL with checks, and the deployed app's review function applies any pending row's patch). Widening it would mean
-- rewriting constraints the running app depends on, and an old build would show a proposed issue as a broken
-- company-model change. A separate table changes nothing that exists, so this is strictly additive (expand only) and
-- safe before, during or after the deploy. Apply it BEFORE deploying this ticket's app, which reads the new table.
--
-- What is new:
--
--   * `public.suggestion_proposals`: workspace, `kind` (`issue` or `solution_idea`), a title, the idea or finding in
--     plain words (`detail`), `payload` (for an issue: `severity`, `type`, `links` [{process_id, step_id}],
--     `target_measure`, `target_now`, `target_goal`; for a solution idea: `steps` [the proposed steps: name, kind, role,
--     block_id ...], `edges`, `replaces_step_ids`, `expect`), cited `evidence`, the AI's reasoning (`note`), for a
--     solution idea the issue it is for (`issue_id`, a real foreign key: the idea goes when the issue does), who made
--     it (`created_via` mcp or play_link, `proposer_name`, `proposer_email`), its `status` (pending, accepted, rejected,
--     dismissed, built), and what accepting did (`applied`: {issue_id, number}).
--   * `public.review_proposals(ids, decision, note)`: accept or reject proposals as the signed-in user (security
--     invoker, so row-level security decides), one at a time, in the shape of `review_suggestions`. A solution idea is
--     "rejected" as `dismissed`; accepting one is refused (it is built in the Editor, slice 2). An API-token request
--     (the MCP server) can't review: a person decides.
--   * `private.suggestion_proposals_before_write`: a new proposal starts pending; a request with a signed-in user is
--     recorded as `mcp` with no visitor details (only a function with no user, such as B4's, can say `play_link`); what
--     was proposed never changes; the decision columns change only inside `review_proposals`.
--
-- Row-level security as `suggestions`: everyone in the workspace reads; owners and editors (and the MCP server acting
-- as one) propose and review. Nobody deletes. Privileges: Supabase gives every new table full rights to anon and
-- authenticated, so this revokes them all and grants back select, insert and an UPDATE limited to the five decision
-- columns.
--
-- Preflight (run with `bash packages/db/scripts/prod-sql.sh -c "..."`; each should be as described):
--
--   1. The table does not exist yet. Expect 0:
--        select count(*) from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'suggestion_proposals';
--   2. Nothing of ours is applied past this one. Expect 0 rows:
--        select version from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version >= '20261124000000';
--   3. A47's save_issue and the policy helpers exist. Expect 4 rows:
--        select proname from pg_proc where pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace and proname in ('save_issue', 'can_read_workspace', 'can_edit_workspace', 'set_updated_at');
--   4. The tables it references exist. Expect 2 rows:
--        select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'public' and table_name in ('issues', 'workspaces');
--
-- Post-apply grant check (authenticated must show INSERT and SELECT only, with UPDATE on exactly the five decision
-- columns; anon nothing at all):
--        select grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.role_table_grants where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'suggestion_proposals' and grantee in ('anon', 'authenticated') order by 1, 2;
--        select column_name from information_schema.column_privileges where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'suggestion_proposals' and grantee = 'authenticated' and privilege_type = 'UPDATE' order by 1;
--   Expect: authenticated INSERT, SELECT; columns applied, review_note, reviewed_at, reviewed_by, status; no anon rows.
--
-- Rollback (run as one transaction; nothing existing was changed, so there is nothing to put back):
--
--   begin;
--   drop function if exists public.review_proposals(uuid[], text, text);
--   drop table if exists public.suggestion_proposals;   -- its indexes, trigger and policies go with it
--   drop function if exists private.suggestion_proposals_before_write();
--   delete from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations where version = '20261124000000';
--   commit;
--
-- Rolling back deletes every pending and decided proposal. Issues that accepted proposals created stay.
--
-- Production data: none needed (no rows means nothing waiting).
