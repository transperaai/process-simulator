// The levers people can switch on or off (Settings -> Levers, issue #123, A58): every input you can change when
// testing, in the prototype's six groups, each with its plain-English description and an example. Wording follows
// the prototype (apps/web/prototype/app-flow.html, LEVERS). A "lever" here is a kind of input ("Time each step
// takes"); the sliders on a process page are generated per step, role or person (levers.ts) and each belongs to one
// kind, so hiding a kind hides all its sliders. Pure: no React, so the wording and the mapping are unit-tested.
